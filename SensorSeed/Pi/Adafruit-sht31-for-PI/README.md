### Enable i2c on the PI in the usual way ###
- Run raspi-confid -> select enable i2c

   -- or --
- This is for raspbian jessie, wheezy is different.
- edit /etc/modules and add
- -   i2c-bcm2708
- -   ic2-dev
- edit /boot/config and add
- -   dtparam=i2c_arm=on
- -   dtparam=i2c1_baudrate=100000   <-  This is default, remove 1 zero for this sht31 implimentation to work.
 
## Prerequisites ##
 
This sh131 implimentation depends on i2c dev lib

- sudo apt-get install libi2c-dev
 
Below is also a good one to have while debugging, but be careful i2cdump from the below cause the sht31 interface to become unstable for me and requires a hard-reset to recover correctly.

- sudo apt-get install i2c-tools
 
on PI make sure below 2 commands are in /boot/config.txt

- dtparam=i2c_arm=on
- dtparam=i2c1_baudrate=10000

I know we are slowing down the baurate from optimal, but it seems to be the most stable setting in my testing. add another 0 to the above baudrate for max setting, ie dtparam=i2c1_baudrate=100000

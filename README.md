# SensorSeed

This is C# code for a custom weather station I built.

There is an outdoor component to the station that collects temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, wind direction, and rain every five minutes. There are four small indoor devices that collect just temperature and humidity data in four rooms every five minutes.
